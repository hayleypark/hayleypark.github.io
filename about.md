I'm currently working in the area of natural language understanding at Amazon in Seattle, WA. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach me at [hayley.uiuc@gmail.com](mailto:hayley.uiuc@gmail.com)

I did my PhD in Computational Linguistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [dissertation](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/125303). I worked on developing computational methods for low-resource languages with my advisor [Prof. Lane Schwartz](http://dowobeha.github.io/). My projects also included [multilingual language modeling (TACL 2021)](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00365/98237/Morphology-Matters-A-Multilingual-Language) and language modeling and [dependency parsing for low-resource languages](https://aclanthology.org/2021.americasnlp-1.14.pdf).

In Summer 2021, I worked on [long document classification using Transformers](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-short.79/) as an Applied Scientist Intern at AWS. I worked as a graduate researcher at the 2019 Sixth Frederick Jelinek Memorial Summer School & Workshop on Speech and Language Technology (JSALT 2019) as a member of the [Neural Polysynthetic Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05477) team in Summer 2019.

During my PhD study, I also completed my MS degree in Statistics (Aug 2021).
Prior to that, I earned a master's degree in Teaching English as a Second Language and published research papers in language assessment with [Prof. Xun Yan](https://linguistics.illinois.edu/directory/profile/xunyan).
