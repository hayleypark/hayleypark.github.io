Yes, I won the Best Student Presentation Award at MwALT 2018! 
My paper, entitled “How rater behavior changes over time: Insights gained from many-facets Rasch modeling in second language writing”, was selected for the award at the 20th MwALT conference in Madison, Wisconsin.
This paper is based on my work on the new EPT rater certification program. Thanks to my advisor Dr Xun Yan, my colleague Hannah Kim, and all the ESL lecturers and graduate TAs who have contributed to this program over the past three years!
