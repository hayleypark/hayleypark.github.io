description: "PhD qualifying exam"
---

I just learned that I passed my PhD qualifying exam (with flying colors, I might add)! I wrote and defended a research paper titled "Deconstructing writing and a writing scale: How a decision tree guides raters through a holistic, profile-based rating scale", which is invited for journal publication next year.

So what's left is just to propose, write and defend a dissertation. That's easy, right? :D
